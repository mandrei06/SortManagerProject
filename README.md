# SortManagerProject

SortManagerProject is a program that will allow a user to sort a randomised array. The general flow of the application is:

- The user is presented with a number of sort algorithms to choose from.
- Decision is given via the command line (using ```Scanner```).
- The program will then ask for the length of an array again via the command line.
- The program should then output:
	- The unsorted randomly generated array
	- The sort algorithm to be used
	- The sorted array after the algorithm has been executed
	- The time taken

The purpose of the program is in principle to test the performance of the algorithms used, and moreover to compare the execution times in order to find the most optimal sorting algorithm.
